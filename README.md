# 🛍️ Shop.co — E-Commerce Demo App

> ⚠️ **This is a DEMO / Work-In-Progress version.** The project is actively being developed — many improvements, fixes, and new pages are still coming. Do not treat this as a final product.

---

## 🎨 Design

The app is based on a Figma community template:
**[E-commerce Website Template — Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/UsntLLhWyGh8PoAk0WQfop/E-commerce-Website-Template--Freebie---Community-?node-id=39-1402&p=f&t=XbTCbPf5XJwEkkw7-0)**

## 📌 About the Project

**Shop.co** is a modern frontend e-commerce application built with **Angular 17+** using the latest framework features: Signals, computed state, `OnPush` change detection, and lazy-loaded routes. The project demonstrates a clean component-driven architecture for a clothing store.

The app currently includes a **Home page**, a **Product Detail page**, and a **Cart page**, with a **Promo/Discount** system already built in.
